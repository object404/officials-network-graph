## Network Graph of Elected Philippine Officials, 2004-2016

A network graph visualization of regional elected Philippine officials from 2004-2016.

Can be used to spot potential political dynasties at a glance by looking at the surname (red) nodes by size. Surname node sizes are proportional to the number of elected individual officials with the same surnames in a region.
